## Data Flow Example (User Booking Advisor)

```
1. User (role=user) clicks "Book Advisor"
   └─> Frontend checks FeatureGate (bookAdvisor)
       └─> POST /bookings with advisorId, date, time

2. Backend checks:
   ├─ authMiddleware: valid token? ✅
   ├─ requireFeature('bookAdvisor'): user has permission? ✅
   └─ Advisor exists and approved? ✅

3. Create BookingRequest:
   ├─ Validate availability slots match
   ├─ Create booking in DB
   └─> Send notification to advisor

4. Advisor (role=advisor) accepts booking
   └─> requireRole('advisor'): ✅
       requireApproved: ✅
       └─> Create AdvisorSession
           └─> Send notification to client

5. Session workflow:
   ├─ Advisor starts session (in-progress)
   ├─ Exchange chat messages
   ├─ Advisor completes session
   ├─ System creates Payment record
   └─> Client rates advisor

6. Payment:
   ├─ Client initiates payment
   │   └─> Send to Stripe/Razorpay
   ├─ Webhook returns success
   ├─ Mark payment completed
   └─> Notify advisor + send to bank account

7. Notifications sent throughout:
   ├─ Booking request created
   ├─ Booking accepted
   ├─ Session started
   ├─ Payment received
   └─> Rating received
```

## What Still Needs Implementation

### High Priority (Before Production):

1. **Database Migration**
   - Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_rbac_and_advisor`
   - Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`

2. **Stripe/Razorpay Integration**
   - Implement post `/payments/webhook` with signature verification
   - Add real payment processing in `/payments/initiate`
   - Set up webhook endpoints in payment gateway

3. **WebSocket Real-Time**
   - Live chat messages in sessions
   - Real-time notification delivery
   - Session status updates

4. **Email Notifications**
   - SendGrid/AWS SES integration
   - Email templates for bookings, payments, sessions
   - SMTP configuration

5. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update AuthContext to use role from token
   - Connect booking flow to POST `/bookings`
   - Implement payment form with token
   - Wire up notifications to display system

### Medium Priority:

6. **Feature Flags Database**
   - Create FeatureFlag model in Prisma
   - Endpoint to enable/disable per-user or per-role
   - Caching strategy for performance

7. **Audit Logging Database**
   - Create AuditLog model
   - Implement logging on sensitive operations
   - Admin view for audit trail

8. **Session Recording**
   - Integrate with video conferencing API
   - Store session recordings
   - Analytics on session duration

### Lower Priority:

9. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Session completion rates
   - Revenue by advisor/service
   - User retention metrics
   - Rating distribution

10. **Advisor Ratings**
    - Review system
    - Photo/verification
    - Specialization tags
    - Availability calendar view
