# 🧪 RBAC Integration Testing Guide

**Complete guide to test the newly integrated RBAC system in your app.**

---

## ✅ What Was Just Implemented

### Files Created:
1. **FeatureGate.tsx** - Component wrapper that checks permissions before rendering
   - Shows access denied message if user lacks permission
   - Displays helpful info about who can access the feature

### Files Modified:
1. **navigation.ts** - Added RBAC metadata to all navigation items
2. **Header.tsx** - Filters navigation items based on role
3. **Sidebar.tsx** - Filters navigation items based on role
4. **App.tsx** - Wrapped feature components with FeatureGate

### Features Protected:
- `bookAdvisor` - Only users and admins (advisors cannot see/access)
- `adminPanel` - Only admins
- `advisorPanel` - Only advisors
- `taxCalculator` - All roles
- All other features - All roles (filtered at nav level)

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test as Regular User

**Setup**:
1. Login with any email except:
   - `shake.job.atgmail.com` (admin)
   - Emails in `VITE_ADVISOR_EMAILS` (advisor)
2. Example: `user@example.com`

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Can see "Book Advisor" in navigation (sidebar & header)
- ✅ Can click and access Book Advisor feature
- ✅ Can see all standard features (accounts, transactions, etc.)
- ✅ Cannot see "Admin Panel" in navigation
- ✅ Cannot see "Advisor Panel" in navigation
- ✅ If somehow access `/admin-feature-panel` (direct URL), see access denied

**Test Steps**:
```
1. Login as user@example.com
2. Look at sidebar - should show:
   ✅ Book Advisor
   ❌ Admin Panel
   ❌ Advisor Panel
3. Look at header menu (mobile) - same as above
4. Click "Book Advisor" - should load normally
5. Try direct URL: enter admin-feature-panel in page
   - Should show: "Access Denied - This feature is not available for your role"
```

### Scenario 2: Test as Advisor

**Setup**:
1. Add email to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   VITE_ADVISOR_EMAILS=advisor@test.com
   ```
2. Restart dev server
3. Login with: `advisor@test.com`

**Expected Results**:
- ❌ Cannot see "Book Advisor" in navigation (HIDDEN)
- ❌ If you somehow access `/book-advisor` directly, see access denied

- ✅ Can see all other features

**Test Steps**:
```
1. Clear browser cache / logout first
2. Update .env.local with your test advisor email

   - Should show: "Access Denied - bookAdvisor feature not available"
8. Click "Advisor Panel" - should load Advisor workspace
```

**Verify in Console**:
```javascript
// Open DevTools → Console
const { role } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__.auth;
console.log('Your role:', role); // Should be 'advisor'

const { hasFeatureAccess } = require('./lib/rbac');
console.log('Can access bookAdvisor?', hasFeatureAccess('advisor', 'bookAdvisor')); // false
console.log('Can access advisorPanel?', hasFeatureAccess('advisor', 'advisorPanel')); // true
```

---

### Scenario 3: Test as Admin

3. Click "Admin Panel" - should show feature control UI
4. Look in admin panel:
   - Should see list of features
   - Should see 4 readiness buttons (Unreleased, Beta, Released, Deprecated)
   - Should be able to click buttons to change status
5. Click "Book Advisor" - should be able to access booking feature
```

**Verify in Console**:
```javascript
const { role } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__.auth;
console.log('Your role:', role); // Should be 'admin'

const { hasFeatureAccess, isAdminEmail } = require('./lib/rbac');
console.log('Email is admin?', isAdminEmail('shake.job.atgmail.com')); // true
console.log('Can access everything?', hasFeatureAccess('admin', 'bookAdvisor')); // true
console.log('Can access adminPanel?', hasFeatureAccess('admin', 'adminPanel')); // true
```

## 🧪 Automated Test Checklist

Copy-paste these into browser console to test:

### Test 1: Navigation Items Filtered Correctly
```javascript
const nav = require('./app/constants/navigation');
const { useAuth } = require('./contexts/AuthContext');
const { role } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__.auth;

// Get visible items for current role
const visibleItems = nav.sidebarMenuItems.filter(item => {
  if (item.roles && item.roles.length > 0) {
    return item.roles.includes(role);
  }
  return true;
});

console.log(`Visible items for ${role}:`, visibleItems.map(i => i.label));
```

### Test 2: Advisor Cannot See Book Advisor
```javascript
const { role } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__.auth;
const nav = require('./app/constants/navigation');

if (role === 'advisor') {
  const hasBookAdvisor = nav.sidebarMenuItems.some(i => i.id === 'book-advisor');
  console.log('Advisor can see Book Advisor?', hasBookAdvisor); // Should be false or filtered out
}
```

### Test 3: Admin Can See Admin Panel
```javascript
const { role } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__.auth;
const nav = require('./app/constants/navigation');

if (role === 'admin') {
  const hasAdminPanel = nav.sidebarMenuItems.some(i => i.id === 'admin-feature-panel');
  console.log('Admin can see Admin Panel?', hasAdminPanel); // Should be true
}
```

### Test 4: FeatureGate Works
```javascript
// Try accessing forbidden feature
const { setCurrentPage } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__;
const { role } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__.auth;

if (role === 'user') {
  setCurrentPage('admin-feature-panel');
  // Should show "Access Denied" UI
  console.log('✅ If you see "Access Denied" screen, FeatureGate is working!');
}
```

### Test 5: Admin Email Lock
```javascript
const { isAdminEmail } = require('./lib/rbac');

console.log('Admin email check:');
console.log('  shake.job.atgmail.com:', isAdminEmail('shake.job.atgmail.com')); // true
console.log('  other@example.com:', isAdminEmail('other@example.com')); // false
console.log('  SHAKE.JOB.ATGMAIL.COM:', isAdminEmail('SHAKE.JOB.ATGMAIL.COM')); // true (case-insensitive)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Book Advisor" still visible for advisors

**Solution**:
1. Check `.env.local` - is the email in `VITE_ADVISOR_EMAILS`?
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Restart dev server (npm run dev)
4. Re-login
5. If still not working:
   ```javascript
   // In console
   const { role } = window.__APP_CONTEXT__.auth;
   console.log('Current role:', role); // Should be 'advisor'
   ```

### Problem: "Admin Panel" not visible for admins

**Solution**:
1. Verify you logged in with: `shake.job.atgmail.com` (exact spelling)
2. Check AuthContext console output:
   - Open console (F12)
   - Look for: "🔐 Admin role assigned to: shake.job.atgmail.com"
   - If you don't see it, email doesn't match exactly
3. Clear cache and try again

### Problem: Access denied showing for everyone

**Solution**:
1. Check `FeatureGate.tsx` is in correct folder: `frontend/src/app/components/`
2. Verify import in App.tsx:
   ```typescript
   import { FeatureGate } from '@/app/components/FeatureGate';
   ```
3. Check useRBAC hook exists: `frontend/src/hooks/useRBAC.ts`
4. Restart dev server

### Problem: No errors but features not filtered

**Solution**:
1. Verify navigation.ts has `feature` field in each item:
   ```typescript
   { id: 'book-advisor', label: 'Book Advisor', icon: BookOpen, feature: 'bookAdvisor' }
   ```
2. Verify Header.tsx and Sidebar.tsx import and use the role:
   ```typescript
   const { role } = useAuth();
   ```
3. Verify filtering logic:
   ```typescript
   const visibleMenuItems = headerMenuItems.filter(item => {
     if (item.roles && item.roles.length > 0) {
       return item.roles.includes(role);
     }
     return true;
   });
   ```

## 📱 Mobile Testing

The RBAC integration works on mobile too. Test:

1. **Mobile Sidebar** (Not visible on mobile, but test on resize)
2. **BottomNav** - Should also filter items
3. **Mobile Header Menu** - Should filter items

**To Test**:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Click device toggle (📱 icon)
3. Select mobile device
4. Test as user, advisor, admin
5. Verify navigation items appear/disappear correctly
