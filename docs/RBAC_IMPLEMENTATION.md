## 📊 Session Management Workflow

### Complete User → Advisor Session Flow

#### Step 1: User Books Advisor
```
User:
- Selects advisor
- Chooses available time slot
- Books session
- Pays amount

Notification:
- Advisor receives "booking_request" notification
```

#### Step 2: Advisor Accepts Booking
```
Advisor:
- Receives notification
- Reviews booking details
- Clicks "Accept" or "Decline"

If Accept:
- Status → "accepted"
- User receives "booking_accepted" notification

If Decline:
- Status → "rejected"
- User receives "booking_rejected" notification
```

#### Step 3: Ready Confirmation
```
When scheduled time arrives:

Advisor:
- Sees "Ready?" confirmation
- Clicks "Ready"

User:
- See "Ready?" confirmation (real-time)
- Clicks "Ready"

Requirement:
- BOTH must click Ready
- Only then session starts
```

#### Step 4: Session Active
```
Both parties:
- Chat/Audio/Video session begins
- Session duration tracked
- Real-time communication

Either party can end session
```

#### Step 5: Completion & Payment
```
When session ends:

System:
1. Mark session "completed"
2. Calculate session amount:
   - Base: Advisor hourly rate
   - Duration: Session minutes
   - Amount: (duration/60 minutes) × hourly rate

3. Process payment:
   - User: Charged full amount
   - Platform: 10% fee (default)
   - Advisor: 90% settlement

4. Send notifications:
   - User: "session_completed"
   - Advisor: "payment_received"
   - Both: Confirmation details

5. Create settlement record:
   - Settlement ID generated
   - Funds transferred to advisor
   - Transaction recorded
```

### Session States
```
pending → accepted → ready → active → completed
```

Only valid state transitions allowed.

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Admin Email Lock
- Admin role is **hardcoded** to `shake.job.atgmail.com`
- No environment variable override possible
- Email validation happens in `rbac.ts`
- Cannot be changed without code modification

### Role-Based Access Control
- All features check role before rendering
- Backend would validate permissions on API calls
- Middleware prevents unauthorized access
- Permission matrix enforced at component level

### Payment Security
- Transaction IDs required for refunds
- Settlement records immutable
- Audit trail for all payments
- Balance checks before processing

---

## 📦 Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
